# Windows Minimal Environment conversion script
### Tested with Windows 10 (1903) and should only be compatible with Windows 10
The **Windows Minimal Environment** conversion script allows users to automate the switch between a Command Prompt shell environment (like on Windows Server Core) and Explorer (the usual Windows Desktop).
It uses a rather dirty way of doing all this though, so do be careful.
The script also contains 2 options under each environment heading.

How do you use it? Well, it's actually rather straightforward! You'll have to agree to knowing that this script is dangerous though.
* Double-click the script file, it'll come up with a UAC prompt, click *Yes*.
* Once you've done that, a Command Prompt window will open with some red text on the screen, type *'I understand'*.
* You'll now have a blue interactive menu. Use the numbers to navigate around and select the environment you want.
